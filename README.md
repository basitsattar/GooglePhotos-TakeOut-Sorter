# GooglePhotos-TakeOut-Sorter

This is a small script that helps in sorting backed up google photos. Google allows you to download 500 photos at a time from
google photos due to which downloading all photos from google photos is quite difficult. 

Another option is google takout (https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout#) but it makes too many folders. There is a folder for 
almost every date. So managing photos become difficult. I have wrote this script for this. It just moves all files from inner folders
to outer folder and removed json files.

I have also included jar file, so you can just open jar file and select the main folder.

Let me know, if you need any other functionality.

Bye
